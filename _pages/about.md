- An engineer with specialized expertise in power system economics and operations;
- A self-motivated PhD Student enjoying mathematics and programming;
- A passionate researcher with interests on decision making under uncertainties (robust/stochastic/chance-constrained optimization), machine learning/data science/statistical learning.

## News 
- \[Feb.2019\] Version 0.1 of the Matlab Toolbox [ConvertChanceConstraint(ccc)](https://github.com/xb00dx/ConvertChanceConstraint-ccc) for Chance-constrained Optimization is open-source on [Github](https://github.com/xb00dx/ConvertChanceConstraint-ccc).
- \[Jan.2019\] Journal Paper "Data-driven Decision Making in Power Systems with Probabilistic Guarantees: Theory and Applications of Chance-constrained Optimization" was submitted to [Annual Reviews in Control](https://www.journals.elsevier.com/annual-reviews-in-control). We provide a comprehensive literature review of methods to solve chance-constrained optimization (CCO) and applications of CCO in power system decision making.
