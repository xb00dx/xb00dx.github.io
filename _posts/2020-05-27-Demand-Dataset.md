This post summarizes a collection of power system datasets for demand-related studies such as demand response (DR) and non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM).


## Dataset related with Electric Vehicle
### Charging Behaviors
- [Caltech ACN Data](https://ev.caltech.edu/dataset)
	- detailed EV data: arrival, (user estimated) departure time, (actual) departure time, kWh, (estimated and actual) length of a session, efficiency
- [PecanStreet](https://www.pecanstreet.org/dataport/about/)
	- many more than EV data, e.g., solar generation, HVAC useage, other appliances

### Driving Behaviors
[Driving Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Driving_cycle)
- [recent] 
- [Obsolete] New European Driving Cycle (1997), Dynamic Driving Cycle
