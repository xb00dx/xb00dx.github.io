This post summarizes a collection of power system datasets for demand-related studies such as demand response (DR) and non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM).

weather data: http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov, hourly temperature data from the National Climatic Data Center

The National Energy Modeling System (NEMS) reported itemized residential load profiles in [45], which are interpreted in [28] to produce a single home daily load profile.
