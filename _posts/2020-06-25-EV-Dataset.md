This post summarizes a collection of datasets for electric vehicle (EV) related datasets.


## Datasets related with Electric Vehicles
### Charging Behaviors

| Name | Source | Description | Note |
|------|--------|-------------|------|
|[Caltech ACN Data](https://ev.caltech.edu/dataset) | Caltech |detailed EV data: arrival, (user estimated) departure time, (actual) departure time, kWh, (estimated and actual) length of a session, efficiency |      |
|[PecanStreet](https://www.pecanstreet.org/dataport/about/) | PecanStreet | mainly EV charging power data, many more than EV data, e.g., solar generation, HVAC useage, other appliances |  |
