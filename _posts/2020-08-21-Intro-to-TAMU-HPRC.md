## Overview
TAMU provides **free** HPRC accounts for everyone
- Students can have free 5000 SUs per year
- Advisors can apply for almost unlimited SUs then assign to students

Please be aware of other free computing resources
- Free Servers at the [Computer Engineering & Systems Group](https://cesg.tamu.edu/tech-resources/) of ECEN
- Check your own department's *technology resources* (e.g., computer science, industrial engineering)

## Background
### Basics
- **Google is your friend**, and learn to use [google search operators](https://moz.com/learn/seo/search-operators) when searching
- Everything is in command line on HPRC, so you need to learn basic command operations (a quick tutorial on [lifehacker](https://lifehacker.com/a-command-line-primer-for-beginners-5633909))
	- make sure you are familar with commands: `cd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `mv`, `rm -r`, `tail -f`
	- On WindowsOS: always use `PowerShell` (do not use `cmd`), always use `Putty` (instead of `ssh` in `Powershell`)
	- On MacOS: use [iterm2](https://www.iterm2.com/)
	- On Linux: Congrats! You made the right choice of OS!

### A little more
- Github, **Free TAMU Github Accounts** [here](https://github.tamu.edu). After Acquired by Microsoft, Github provides free private repos (with limited collaborators)
- Code editor: VIM, [an interactive tutorial](https://www.openvim.com/), [VIM primer](https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim/) [VIM cheatsheet](https://vim.rtorr.com/), for fun: [Emacs versus VIM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war)
- Knowledge about Bash is also helpful, [learn bash in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/bash/)

### Software Recommendations
In general
- use `git` to manage your code (NOT data)
- (optional) use softwares like `Fugu`/`WinSCP` to sync large files (e.g., your data and tensorflow model), command `rsync` is another option

#### Windows
- best ssh tool: [Putty](https://www.putty.org/)
- best FTP tool for data transfer: [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php)

#### MacOS
- command line tool: iterm2 with [oh my zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- data transfer: [Fugu](https://sourceforge.net/projects/fugussh/files/)

#### Linux 
- data sync (can be installed on TAMU HPRC): [google drive linux client](https://github.com/odeke-em/drive) or [odrive](https://www.odrive.com/)
