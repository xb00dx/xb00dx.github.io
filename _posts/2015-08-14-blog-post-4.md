Faculty Job Seach
------
- Apply broadly to a wide range of universities, Twenty to forty schools is reasonable
- Contact professors wherever you are applying if you or your mentors know any faculty there. I had personal contacts at 8 of the 10 schools where I got interviews; either I knew someone there, or one of my mentors knew someone and put in a good word for me. Don't feel bashful about emailing relevant faculty, even if you aren't particularly close to them; they want to hire good people who do work that interests them. As long as you send a concise and well-written email, people won't dismiss you as a spammer.
