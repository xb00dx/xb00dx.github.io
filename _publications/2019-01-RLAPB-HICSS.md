Increasing penetration of highly variable components such as solar generation and electric vehicle charging loads pose significant challenges to keeping three-phase loads balanced in modern distribution systems. Failure to maintain balance across three phases would lead to asset deterioration and increasing delivery losses. Motivated by the real-world needs to automate and optimize the three-phase balancing decision making, this paper introduces a robust look-ahead optimization framework that pursues balanced phases in the presence of demand-side uncertainties. We show that look-ahead moving window optimization can reduce imbalances among phases at the cost of a limited number of phase swapping operations. Case studies quantify the improvements of the proposed methods compared with conventional deterministic phase balancing. Discussions on possible benefits of the proposed methods and extensions are presented.
